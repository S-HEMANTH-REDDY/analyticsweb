## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git (for version control)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd express-blog-analytics
Install the project dependencies:

bash

npm install
Usage
Starting the Server
To start the Express server, run:

bash

npm start
By default, the server will listen on port 3000. You can change the port by setting the PORT environment variable.

Endpoints
GET /api/blog-stats: Fetches blog data from the third-party API, performs analytics, and returns statistics such as the total number of blogs, longest blog title, number of blogs with "privacy" in the title, and an array of unique blog titles.

GET /api/blog-search?query=<search_query>: Searches for blogs based on the provided query string (case-insensitive) and returns matching blogs.

Project Structure
The project is organized into different directories and files:

server.js: The main entry point of the Express application.
routes/: Contains route definitions for different API endpoints.
controllers/: Contains route handlers and logic for each API endpoint.
middleware/: Custom middleware for error handling.
utils/: Utility functions for Lodash-related operations.
package.json: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
Error Handling
Custom error handling middleware is implemented to handle errors that may occur during data retrieval, analysis, or search processes. Proper error messages and HTTP status codes are returned in the responses.
